# CoC 7e Quick Excerpt

- Resolve uncertain actions with d100 against a relevant characteristic or skill.
- A roll is a success when the result is less than or equal to the target value.
- Difficulty tiers: regular, hard (half), and extreme (one-fifth) thresholds.
- Opposed checks compare success tiers first; ties may compare rolled values.
- Investigative pacing favors clues and consequences over hard dead-ends.
- Sanity pressure should be reflected in tone and risk-aware decision making.
