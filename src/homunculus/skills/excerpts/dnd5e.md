# DnD 5e Quick Excerpt

- Actions are resolved by d20 checks plus ability and proficiency modifiers.
- Advantage and disadvantage roll two d20 and keep the higher or lower result.
- Combat economy uses action, possible bonus action, movement, and reaction.
- Armor Class and saving throws define core defensive resolution paths.
- Spell and class resources are finite and should be tracked across scenes.
- Rulings should preserve class fantasy, table pacing, and clear consequences.
